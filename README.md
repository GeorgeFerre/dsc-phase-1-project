Giving recommendations to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio and help decide what type of films to create that will be most profitable.

Writers are the ideal to create a great story line that all will want to see.
The best possiable directors to lead the moive to be a smach hit.

## Data Understanding

Will we be using data from three different place.

Rotten Tomatoes, one the world’s most trusted recommendation resources for quality entertainment.
The Movie Database (TMDb), which is a massive community built movie and TV database.
The Numbers, the largest freely available database of movie industry information on the web.

## Methods

This project analyzes the average worldwide gross for the different genres that have been made in the last 20 years. We also took a look at the rating vs gross ratio from rotten tomatoes to see if there is a correlation between the two.

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between the two. However, we can still take both into account using a new number that we will call the Gross Profit x Freshness (GxF) ratio. The GxF will be calculated by multiplying the box office numbers with our freshness rating.

## Results

Using this information, we can pull the top 5 writers and directors in each genre. For our purposes here, we will look at the top 3: Animation, Adventure, and Fantasy.

We can take the top five prospects based on quality ratio. Looking at our newly created graphs, we can see that there is a bit of a dip in quality ratio after the first one or two prospects. This does not necessarily indicate that the other choices of the top five are bad, but that we want to more aggressively go after the top one or two writers in each category.

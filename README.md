## Data Understanding
=======
Proposal for Microsoft Movie Studio
=======
### Overview

This project will offer suggestions to Microsoft on how to start a movie studio. Because Microsoft would be a new player in the movie business, we will assume they are starting from scratch and need to suggest a good starting point to launch the studio. We will begin an exploratory analysis of movie data to make suggestions on how to start making movies.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. It is important for this venture to be profitable, but we will also make sure that films have good audience and critical reception to establish Microsoft's new studio as a longterm player in the film industry.

This project analyzes the average worldwide gross for the different genres that have been made in the last 20 years. We also took a look at the rating vs gross ratio from rotten tomatoes to see if there is a correlation between the two.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between the two. However, we can still take both into account using a new number that we will call the Gross Profit x Freshness (GxF) ratio. The GxF will be calculated by multiplying the box office numbers with our freshness rating.

## Results

So base of an averge of worldwide gross for each genre, it looks like are top three genres are animation, adventure, and fantasy just beating over family. Using this information, we can pull the top 5 writers and directors in each genre. For our purposes here, we will look at the top 3: Animation, Adventure, and Fantasy.

### Key Points
>>>>>>> 28556bbef9382c6ed151e1923ab752ee821aacbe

We can take the top five prospects based on quality ratio. Looking at our newly created graphs, we can see that there is a bit of a dip in quality ratio after the first one or two prospects. This does not necessarily indicate that the other choices of the top five are bad, but that we want to more aggressively go after the top one or two writers in each category.

We see a similar situation when viewing the top five directors based on FxG in each genre. We want to put more effort into reaching out to the top two prospects in each genre.
